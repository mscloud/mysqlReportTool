<!-- to-do list -->
UDF tests:
    Try to break tables that are processed (wrong format, duplicate keys)
    Try situations for pop_stat where some of input values are NULL
    Check if avg1 and avg3 can really be NULL

Transactions:
    Check if transactions are relevant for some procedures.

General:
    try using default values for local variables (e.g. p_status).

pop_def(curtime, p_status)
    Add a counter for newly inserted rows, total number of rows, and deleted rows.
    Mark items that are not found in zabbix as "obsolete", and keep them.

pop_stat(curtime, p_status)
    Add dif1 and avg3dif and dif30 calculations.
    replace freq3 and freq30 with availaibility3 and availability30 (count30 / 720 * 100 %)

out_stat()
    Remove "get current values" operation. 
    Think of some good and informative join.
    Role must be parsed into 3 columns: location, venue, function.
    Comments, of course.

out_cur()
    Write a new function to get (only) current values, nothing else.

open_sum(curtime)
    Add counters: added, removed, total lines for `def` and `hist`.
