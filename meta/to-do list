<!-- to-do list -->

pop_def(curtime, p_status)
    Add a counter for newly inserted rows, total number of rows, and deleted rows.

pop_stat(curtime, p_status)
    dev is useless. d(avg1)/d(t=1day) is more informative. See notebook for more details.
    Exclude `cur` column.

report_master()
    Add comments.

open_sum(curtime)
    Add comments.

out_stat()
    Remove "get current values" operation. 
    Think of some good and informative join.
    Role must be parsed into 3 columns: location, venue, function.
    Comments, of course.

out_cur()
    Write a new function to get (only) current values, nothing else.

Done:
Database privileges.
