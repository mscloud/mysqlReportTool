pop_stat(curtime, p_status)
    debug.

out_stat() & out_cur()
    Add comments.

open_sum(curtime)
    Add counters: added, removed, total lines for `def` and `hist`.

pop_def(curtime, p_status)
    Add a counter for newly inserted rows, total number of rows, and deleted rows.
    Mark items that are not found in zabbix as "obsolete", and keep them.

UDF tests:
    Try to break tables that are processed (wrong format, duplicate keys)
    Try situations for pop_stat where some of input values are NULL
    Check if avg1 and avg3 can really be NULL

Transactions:
    Check if transactions are relevant for some procedures.

General:
    try using default values for local variables (e.g. p_status).
